    "QUESTION": "Concerning Lassa fever:",
    "OPTION": {
      "A": "It occurs majorly in the West African Sub-region",
      "B": "It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta only",
      "C": "The disease is endemic in the rodent population in parts of North America",

      "A": "The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%",
      "B": "Case fatality rates have varied from 2% to 9% in past outbreaks",
      "C": "The virus is transmitted to people from all wild animals",
      "D": "Ebola virus disease, formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans",
      "E": "The virus spreads in the human population through animal-to-human transmission"
    },
    "TRUE": ["A", "D", "E"],
    "FALSE": ["B", "C"],
    "EXPLANATION": "CFR varies widely; virus not transmitted by all wild animals."

    "QUESTION": "The following statements about non-parametric tests are true",
    "OPTION": {
      "A": "It does not assume any particular functional form for a population distribution",
      "B": "They are distribution free methods based on ordered statistic theory",
      "C": "Their hypothesis focuses on nature of distribution alone rather than values",
      "D": "It is weaker than parametric tests in situations where data satisfies the assumptions",
      "E": "They are less useful on classificatory variables"

    "TRUE": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    "FALSE": ["E"],

    "QUESTION": "In applying the T-test, the following criteria or assumptions must be met:",
    "OPTION": {
      "A": "Data must be quantitative in nature",
      "B": "The parent population standard deviation is known",
      "C": "The two groups compared have similar variances",
      "D": "Samples should be random in nature",
      "E": "It must be of a known scale"

    "FALSE": ["B"],

  "QUESTION": "Considering the uses of median as a measure of central tendency the following is true",
  "OPTION": {
    "A": "It is affected by outliers",
    "B": "Can be calculated if extreme class is open",
    "C": "Cannot be determined directly for odd number observations",
    "D": "Affected by fluctuations of sampling",
    "E": "It is used for irregular distributions"
  },
  "TRUE": ["B", "D", "E"],
  "FALSE": ["A", "C"],
  "EXPLANATION": "Median is robust to outliers (so A is false). It can often be estimated even when an extreme class is open (B true). Median is directly determined for odd-numbered observations (C false). Median may vary with sampling (D true) and is useful for irregular/skewed distributions (E true)."

    "QUESTION": "The following measures of dispersion or variability can be used for calculating individual observations",
    "OPTION": {

    "FALSE": ["C", "D"],
    "EXPLANATION": "Standard deviation, coefficient of variation and inter-quartile range describe dispersion of individual observations. Standard errors (mean/proportion) describe variability of estimates across samples, not dispersion of individual observations."
